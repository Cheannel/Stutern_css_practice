       <h1><i>Details of Myself and My Love for Technology</i></h1>
       <h2>This write-up contains my name and a description of my love for technology</h2>
       <p><b>My name is Lughas Immaculata Chiamaka. 
       First, technology is the development of knowledge into inventories for practical and research purposes. 
       Everything about technology is fascinating to me, and I'm so excited to be born in this technological era. 
       I have read historical documentation, and seen a few movies portraying what life used to be like in the olden days, 
       where people have to travel on animals for days, even weeks before getting to certain destinations or even before they can deliver messages,
        when trade by barter was their means of trading, how people work tirelessly and manually to get jobs done, 
        a fire was used for sending signals, there were no amenities, men and women could drink from the same water where they wash, and have their baths. 
        There are so many other methods, systems and actions that were so uncalled-for, restricted and very awful practices and ways of livelihood. The means of habitation were very substandard.
       As years come by, there started becoming little changes as a result of the evolution of technology. Where caving on stones changed to the use of letters, later to the radio, 
       then the television set was invented, the telephone came into existence, then computers and now a good number of technological devices have evolved. 
       A few examples of these devices include the mobile phone, which aids in communication, the television set, which helps in the transmission of visual and audio contents, 
       the internet which gives a wider coverage for the connection of more than one computer or sophisticated gadgets, cars, laptops, washing machine, water dispenser, x-ray machine, etc. 
       Making the means, standard and manner of living a blast for myself and every other person, our lives, very easy and more suitable compared to the archaic world.
       Technology has been an eye-opener for me, and aspiring to be a Tech Practitioner is also a thing of joy to me. In the past years, the rate of increase of technology keeps increasing, 
       also giving a rise to the number of things that have been improved since technology came into existence. 
       I am one of the people from different walks of life, who are fascinated by the way technology is advancing at this profuse rate, 
       constructing our lives into the digital age. I greatly admire the whole phenomenon and its speed towards changing our lives, enhancing our means of livelihood, 
       and exposing the world to a quite number of things that have been tagged impossible. 
       I have dedicated my whole self to doing technology-related jobs and has also promised myself to help orientate the younger generations and, 
       also adult who have low knowledge of technology, what it is, how great it works, its advantages, benefits, 
       and how well it can cause an effect to their immediate environment or society at large, for I know how extensively technology has impacted in my life.</b></p>
